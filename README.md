# Experiments for the course of Deep Learning Application
This is the repository we use to keep stored the experiments done in the course of Deep Learning Applications at University of Florence (Italy) in Spring 2024.

All the experiments are done by [Niccol√≤ Niccoli](https://github.com/niccoloniccoli) and [Silvia Dani](https://github.com/SilviaDani) together.

## To run the experiments
If you want to run anyone of our experiments, please do `pip install requirements.txt`. <br>
This will work for every experiment except for the bonus experiment in Lab 3 where the packages you need are in `requirements_atari.txt` (you also need a Python version >= 3.8 and <= 3.11 ).
